### Currently

- working as an ML/DL application developer.


### Here is a bit about myself

- I studied korean language and literature at uni. (literature and philosophy were my biggest concerns for a long time.)
- I am quite good with abstract concepts, and I learn from my own doubts.
- I usually search in english to study tech-related stuff.
- My priority has been to implement various ML/DL applications to gain experiences. Now I plan to understand fundamentals more.
