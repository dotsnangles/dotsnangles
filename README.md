### Currently

- working as an ML/DL application developer.


### Here is a bit about myself

- I studied Korean Language and Literature at university.
- Literature and philosophy were my biggest concerns for a long time.
- I am quite good with abstract concepts, and I learn from my own doubts.
- I search the web in English rather than Korean when it's tech-related since the articles are usually more structured, detailed and precise.
- My priority has been to implement various ML/DL applications to gain experiences in 2022.
- I plan to understand fundamentals more in 2023.
